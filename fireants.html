<h2><strong>Fire Ants</strong><br></h2> 
You decide to walk by the fire ant colony.<br> 
You blink and before you know it, you are a fire ant<br> 
There are tons of ants all around you doing their day-to-day activities<br> 
Some are carrying bits of dead animals while others<br> 
Are carrying crispy pieces of lettuce<br> 
This area is very different from your habitat that your people <br> 
used to live in since it was much more tropical.<br> 
You see some figure walking around a foot or two away. <br> 
You get a bad feeling about this spooky figure.<br> 
Do you decide to investigate?<br>

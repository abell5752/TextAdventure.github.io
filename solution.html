<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2><br> 
You decide that you can make a change<br>  
You do not want buffelgrass to ruin your life anymore<br>   
You’ll show them<br>  
You do some research and find that there are various methods<br>  
of removing buffelgrass as a species<br>  
Since it is an invasive species<br>  
You believe that chemical control will be the most effective<br>  
after looking at all the options<br>  
You will use glyphosate, an herbicide that is relatively safe<br>  
for most plants and very effective for buffelgrass<br>  
Your home state of Arizona has 73 million acres and buffelgrass covers<br>  
about an eighth of the area in some way or another, <br>
even if it may be sparse<br>  
For the herbicide, it takes about 2.5 quarts per acre<br>  
Factoring in the area, it takes about<br>
5.7 million gallons of herbicide<br>  
For a highball estimate at the prices of amazon, <br>
the costs of the herbicide<br>  
will be approximately 175 million dollars,<br>
and you even get free shipping!<br>  
With only herbicide, it will just sit there,<br>
so you need a crop duster to<br>  
Spread it for you, so you find one to do it<br>
for about 15 dollars per acre<br>  
To bring you to a cost of 69 million dollars.<br>  
This is very expensive at 244 million dollars, so you<br>  
decide to go to the state of Arizona Department of Conservation<br>  
(1 year later)<br>  
The project for dusting herbicide<br>
on the buffelgrass has been going great!<br>  
The project has about 1 year left of semi-annual dusting, but the<br>  
Herbicide proved to be very effective!<br>  
The Arizona state government got the stores selling buffel grass seeds<br>  
To also stop selling their stock in order to control the population<br>  
and promote local growth!<br>  
Your winner!<br>

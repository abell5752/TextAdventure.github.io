<h2><strong>African Foxtail</strong></h2><br>
You move closer to the African Foxtail to get a bite.<br>
The grass is not that hard to find<br>
It’s all over the arizona desert <br>
It wasn't originally here it was an invasive species brought from Africa<br>
But I’m an animal, so how would I know about that?<br>

Look like it’s time for you to die<br>

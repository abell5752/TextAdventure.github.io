You awake and your a coyote<br> 
Your full because you have just eaten a primary consumer<br> 
You are a secondary consumer and feeling confident<br> 
You leave your pups behind in your, which is in the ground<br> 
You're out exploring and you see some cactuses and other wildlife<br> 
The desert is boring as always and nothing wants to fight<br> 
You are hungry and see a group of beetles<br> 
A verdin is always starting to eat the beetles too<br>  
You run over their and eat the beetles and scare the Verdin off<br> 
This is interspecific competition<br> 
After walking for a bit you decide to sun on a rock<br>

<h2><strong>Cactus</strong><br></h2> 
You feel yourself being absorbed into something familiar.<br>  
You are a Cactus.<br>  
You look around, and you see that the desert has not changed.<br>  
There is a figure running towards you with a saw.<br> 
You wonder what this figure is, running on its two legs.<br> 
The creature starts to move its saw back and forth upon you.<br> 
You breathe in deeply, despite being a cactus.<br> 
“Here we go again,” you think.<br> 
Everything goes dark.

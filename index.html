<h2><strong>Welcome to Cactusville! </strong></h2><br>
You are a cactus in southern Arizona just going about<br>
 your daily procedure of drinking water and absorbing <br>
the sun to make food as a producer.<br>
All the Bees around you are drinking your nectar from your flowers <br>
And you feel great from this mutually beneficial<br>
or symbiotic relationship <br>
They take your nectar and get fed while<br>
they pollinate you and spread your pollen<br>
Without your best friend and keystone species, the bees,<br> 
you would die along with many other plants<br>
And the effects would be catastrophic for the environment.<br>
Many organisms going about their day are around you.<br>
This interests you and you decide to investigate.<br>
There are two animals in front of you. <br>
These animals usually don’t bother you, <br>
but they look really thirsty and willing to eat you. <br>
Which one do you want to eat you?<br>
The mouse or the rabbit? <br>

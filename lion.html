<h2><strong>Mountain lion</strong></h2><br> 
You awaken and you are a mountain lion<br> 
You look around hoping that your a lion but<br>
see that your in the desert<br> 
Your the Apex predator in the southwest Arizona region.<br>
You are a carnivore<br> 
Your diet consist of mostly any small snake or coyote around<br> 
You are still full and decide to take a nap<br> 
You awake from the nap and see that it is dark out<br> 
It's your time to go and hunt<br> 
It's getting colder and you see a rabbit sleeping across the road<br> 
You take your time heading up to the road<br> 
The rabbit is still sleeping and your excited for an easy catch<br> 
You run across the road without checking<br> 
The car hits you and your dead<br>

<h2><strong>Golden eagle</strong></h2><br> 
You are a golden eagle<br> 
One of the main scavengers and an Apex predator in the desert<br> 
You are still flying high above the desert looking for dead animals<br> 
That is your job<br> 
You have the special task of eating dead animals <br>
in the desert<br> 
You have to compete with the vulture which is interspecific competition<br> 
Back to your job<br> 
You're tasked with eating dead animals because their a few decomposers<br> 
So your gifted with the task of getting the energy <br>
back into the environment<br> 
Your still flying thinking about how cool your niche is<br> 
You suddenly feel a sharp object rip through your body<br> 
Its a bullet and you have died<br>

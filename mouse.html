<h2><strong>Mouse</strong></h2>
You open your eyes and you are a mouse<br>
You are starving and looking for a food source<br>
As a primary consumer the main diet of the Desert Mouse are<br>
seeds from plants<br>
You spot the African Foxtail plant near by<br>
You spot the other mice eating the African Foxtail which is your dinner<br>
You go over and scare the other mice away with your nest. <br>
This is an example of intraspecific competition. <br>
Walking back to your habitat, <br>
which is a hole underground you spot Fire Ants <br>

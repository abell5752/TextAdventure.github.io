<h2><strong>Buffel Grass</strong></h2><br>

You move closer to the Buffel grass to get a bite.<br>
The grass is not that hard to find<br>
It’s all over the arizona desert <br>
It wasn't originally here it was an invasive species brought from Africa<br>
But I’m an animal, so how would I know about that?<br>
The buffel grass has been growing exponentially ever sense.<br>
The grass keeps catching on fire too, what a mess<br>
You notice a snake slithering to your left about to bite<br>
And a coyote sneaking to your right<br>
Look like it’s time for you to die<br>
So, who will get eaten by?<br>

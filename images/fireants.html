<h2><strong>Fire Ants</strong></h2><br>
You decide to walk by the fire ant colony.<br>
You blink and before you know it, you are a fire ant<br>
There are tons of ants all around you doing their day-to-day activities<br>
Some are carrying bits of dead animals while others<br>
Are carrying crispy pieces of lettuce<br>
This area is very different from your habitat that your people <br>
used to live in since it was much more tropical.<br>
You see some figure walking around a foot or two away. <br>
You get a bad feeling about this spooky figure.<br>
Do you decide to investigate?<br>

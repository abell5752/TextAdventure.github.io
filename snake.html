<h2><strong>Rattlesnake</strong></h2><br> 
Your scaliness is the first thing you feel as you wake up<br> 
The thirst for food is on your head<br> 
Looking around, you see many different organisms<br> 
One of the closest ones is the Buffelgrass<br> 
You know that it's a common food source for many different organisms<br> 
One of the most common are rabbits<br> 
It's also a breeding ground for those rabbits, <br>
so there will be a lot of them<br> 
Slithering around, you see a rabbit and go in for the kill<br> 
After your meal, you decide to take a breather and sleep<br> 
In the morning, you feel hungry again<br> 
There are multiple places that you can go<br> 
One is a cliff and another is a plain<br>

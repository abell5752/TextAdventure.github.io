<h2><strong>Human</strong><br></h2> 
You are now a human named Geoff. The king of all animals<br>  
You gaze around and see the devastation<br>
that you have caused upon the desert<br>
as you chow down on a piece of pear cactus.<br>  
First you wonder how the this desert came to be<br>
with all of these different species<br>  
So you decide to look at the population distribution of the desert<br>   
As you dive further into the distribution<br>
you realise that their are many types<br>  
You look around and realize that <br>
they’re is a clumped distribution in the desert<br>  
From what you experienced going through the food web, the organisms<br>
can be found all over the desert in clumps with their species.<br>  
This can be because of the scarce food in the desert.<br>
The main point here is that clumped distribution<br>
is when population of species are<br>
clumped together throughout the environment<br>   
You Are amazed and decide to look at <br>
the scenario of succession in the desert<br>   
You again look around and realize that this is crucial for the desert<br>  
Now that plants are inhabitants of the desert animals <br>
will migrate and settle here<br>  
Once the primary consumers arrive like mice the secondary, tertiary<br>
and apex consumers will settle in the desert<br>  
 Creating a brand new ecosystem from the one that was destroyed<br>  
You’re astounded<br>  
Who knew the desert can be this cool<br>  
You decide to help recover the desert and start a conservation project<br>

<h2><strong>Vulture</strong><br></h2> 
You walk over to the road slowly and a big block is speeding towards you.<br>  
Everything goes black.<br> 
You awaken and you are a vulture eating your daily meal, freshly killed.<br> 
You are glad because now you are a scavenger<br>
and all the food you eat is dead.<br> 
There are not many animals like you in the area<br> 
You don’t have to fight very hard for food because<br>
you fill a specific niche in this environment<br> 
There are not many like you<br> 
You are the beginning of every end, and the end of time and space<br> 
You are vulture<br> 
And all roads lead to you<br> 
As you think this, you die unexpectedly<br> 
You crash down into the sand and there are beetles and millipedes around you<br> 
Which do you want to eat you?<br>

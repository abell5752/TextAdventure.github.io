<h2><strong>Pangolin</strong></h2> 
You are a pangolin<br> 
Pangolin’s are mammals that eat plants and ants<br> 
Food is the only thing that is in your mind<br> 
You gotta find a food source quick <br> 
You see a ant hill located nearby<br> 
A quick snack is guaranteed<br> 
The ants provide you with a near-limitless foodsource<br> 
After you eat from the anthill you find a place to chill<br> 
You find a chilly spot near a cliff<br> 
What do you want to do?<br>

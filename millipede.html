<h2><strong>Millipede</strong></h2>
You are a decomposer<br>
You feast on the remains on dead organisms<br>
Millipedes have a long life, so they get to<br>
remember many different areas to feast<br>
Eating the remains of a vulture makes you feel full<br>
Eating a little makes you full, a little too full<br>
Death has come because you ate too much<br>
